## Getting Started

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Development:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Production Build:**
   ```bash
   docker build --target production -t photo-gallery .
   docker run -p 3000:3000 photo-gallery
   ```

### Local Development (without Docker)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Content Management

Events are managed through markdown files in the `content/events/` directory. Each event should be a separate `.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

### Markdown File Format

Create a new file in `content/events/` with the following structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Event Name"
date: "2024-01-15"
description: "Event description"
albums:
  - name: "Album 1"
    url: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/..."
  - name: "Album 2"
    url: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/..."
thumbnails:
  - url: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/..."
  - url: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/..."
---
Optional markdown content for additional details.
```

### Fields

- **title**: Event name (required)
- **date**: Event date in YYYY-MM-DD format (required)
- **description**: Short description of the event (required)
- **albums**: Array of album objects with `name` and `url` (required)
- **thumbnails**: Array of thumbnail objects with `url` (optional, but recommended)
- **Content**: Optional markdown content below the frontmatter

### Event Type Filtering

Event types are automatically inferred from event names. For example:
- "Wedding 2024" → "Wedding"
- "Concert 2023" → "Concert"
- "Birthday Party - 2024" → "Birthday Party"

The system removes years and common suffixes to group similar events together.
