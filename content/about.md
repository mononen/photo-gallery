Howdy, welcome to my photography portfolio.
My name is Alex, and I'm typically riding around a OneWheel event with a big camera.

## My Story

I started photography as a hobby and took a few classes on film photography in college, and fell in love. 

In 2021 I tried out a friends OneWheel and was hooked. I bought my own Pint, XR, then began building my own.
Moved down to the Triangle of NC, and joined [Oak City OneWheel](https://www.oakcityonewheel.com/), where I met some lifelong friends.

## Hardware

### Cameras
I have a Sony A7RII that I will shoot on, or more often 'loan' out to friends
I also frequently borrow a camera or two from [Cory Boehne](https://www.facebook.com/cory.boehne) of [Armor-Dilloz](https://armor-dilloz.com/)

### Boards
I'm most likely riding a board that I have built, certainly a vesc of some variety.
Latest hardware is some fun 30s odds and ends built by myself at [MonoMotion](https://monomotion.org)
